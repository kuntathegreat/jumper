Today I don't feel like doing anything. 
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
 Uh I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the TV on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I cant, no
I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man
Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can
</p>
